Just walked out of Creation of the Gods II: Demon Force and, man, where do I even start? First, okay, let me just say, why does everything need to be a trilogy? I’m barely recovered from the first installment, and here we are again with enough visuals to fry my brain. Those CGI monsters actually looked like they escaped from someone’s fever dream. One minute they’re roaring in a pit of flames, the next they’re doing interpretive dance moves. Seriously, who even thinks this stuff up?

I gotta admit though, the film did this weird thing where it sucked me in and spit me out in intervals. There was a moment, right smack in the middle, where I thought—I kid you not—that I forgot the laws of physics. Like some wizard waved his stick, and BAM! Suddenly we're all swimming in some existential whirlpool. Does any of it make sense? Does it matter if it makes sense? I don't even know anymore. Maybe I've been reading too much Nietzsche.

>Halfway through, there was this epic battle scene and I was just thinking: wow, this is art. Not in the hanging in a museum sense but in a my eyes are being punched repeatedly way. And then there's that main character, whose name I can't remember because let's be honest, they have names that sound like anagrams of each other. What's his face—the slightly brooding one—could've made a rock weep, or laugh, depending on which facial expression he used.

There was this moment, by the way, when a minor character just monologues about destiny while a demon casually dismantles a mountain. I almost laughed, almost cried, couldn't decide, moved on. I suppose it's the beauty of cinema or whatever. Is it pretentious? Eh, maybe. Do I care? Double eh. 

Came home and Googled the lore, because clearly I didn’t understand at least 72% of that film. Found myself regretting it 30 seconds in. There's more depth in that mythology than in my morning coffee. Would I recommend you download the movie or watch the movie? Sure, why not. Just bring snacks and leave skepticism at the door.

Came across this random bit of text online:

```csharp
void SummonDemon(string type) {
    if(type == Ferocious){
        SummonChaos();
    } else {
        Console.WriteLine(No demon for you today.);
    }
}
```

Anyway, walking out, just had this thought—did I enjoy it? Depends on which minute. Like, ask me again in a month and maybe I'll have a coherent answer. But for now, it was an experience. Not sure if it changed my life or anything, but definitely did something weird to my sleep schedule. Also, nobody warned me about the sudden urge to question reality after. Thanks, movie.
